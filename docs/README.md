# Overview
This app is to help me grow in 2 important areas in my life: Android development and triathlon training. I first began android development in 2015 and completed my first triathlon in 2017.
The following is a quick overview of topics covered in the docs:
## QuickStart
How to start the app, run tests, and any additional requirements to run experimental branches.
## Technical Decisions
Each technical decision will be recorded with pros and cons to give a greater understand into my dev habits, and so that I can reflect on my decisions as I grow.
## The Training Plan
The training plan will evolve over time. Since I am not an expert, I will be utilizing articles, books, and coaches to help form the training plan. In this section, I will capture some of the guiding principles that will shape the algorithms used to generate workouts.
